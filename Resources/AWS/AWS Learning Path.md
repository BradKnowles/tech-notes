Happy to share an updated study guide for AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification with many links to FREE official AWS resources including an exam readiness course, a list of hands-on labs, and free practice tests! 

 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟏: Complete one of the video courses on the list and exam readiness course on AWS Skillbuilder.  

  𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟐: Read whitepapers and AWS Service FAQs. Many questions on the exam come from these sources. 

 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟑: Use practice tests to check your exam readiness until you consistently score over 80% and schedule your certification exam. You’ve got this!  

 This year I helped hundreds of individuals to achieve their AWS certifications. Let's set new goals for 2022 and get them done 💪
