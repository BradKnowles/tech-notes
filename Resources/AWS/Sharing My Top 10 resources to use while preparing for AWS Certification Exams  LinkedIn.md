# Sharing My Top 10 resources to use while preparing for AWS Certification Exams | LinkedIn
---
_Hello! In this article, I will share resources that helped me and many others to study and pass AWS certification exams. As a Women In Cloud Ambassador and Learning & Development Lead at my previous job, I relied on these resources to guide individuals to step through their learning journey. Now, I am excited to share them with you to build your expertise in the cloud-computing world!_

1.  [Explore the Official AWS Training website](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/)

It is the number one place to get the most up-to-date information on currently available certifications. You can find an overview of all available certifications, register for free online training, get exam guides and sample questions, and read documentations.

2. [Create an AWS free account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

Nothing is better than real practice! Create a free account and start exploring services and build solutions.

3. [Build common use cases using step-by-step instructions on qwikLABS](https://run.qwiklabs.com/)

Great place to find labs for different levels, starting from a 30 minutes introductory level to a multi-day expert level. Most introductory labs are free.

4. [Try A Cloud Guru](https://acloudguru.com/)

Personally, it is my favorite learning platform. It is a one-stop place where you can watch video courses, get hands-on experience, practice quizzes, and even participate in discussions and ask questions using forums. If I had to stick to one learning platform, that would be it. Oh, ACG has an awesome app! I watched most videos on the app at 1.2x speed. You can try it for free for 7 days.

5. [Check out Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/)

A good option if you don't want to subscribe to a monthly plan. Instead, you can pay $10-$15 and buy a full course on Udemy and study at your own pace. I've heard positive recommendations on the AWS Solution Architect Associate course by Stephane Maarek.

6. [Review AWS Cheat Sheets](https://tutorialsdojo.com/links-to-all-aws-cheat-sheets/)

Cheat sheets provide an overview of all the core services and concepts needed to pass exams. Cheat sheets are free! You can buy additional practice exams on the website.

7. [Need more practice exams? Check Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/)

I found whizlabs practice exam questions similar to the ones I encountered during the actual exam. Some questions are free, a package of several practice exams cost less than $20. Whizlabs always have some promotions available. Check for discounts.

8. [Need more information? Search on YouTube or LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me)

If you have a LinkedIn Premium, it can be a good source to fill knowledge gaps. Let's say you identified that you need to gain a deeper understanding of encryption, then search this topic and watch a short video. If you don't have a Premium account, then use YouTube! It has great content but it might take longer to find it. 

9. [You finished the course. You practiced quizzes. Now it's time to take an official practice exam!](https://www.aws.training/certification)

Try to solve a practice test before you take an actual exam. Associate practice exams include 20 questions, and professional exams have 40 questions. If you score over 80%, don't wait and schedule your exam! If you make a mistake during your official practice exam, you won't know which answer was wrong. Therefore it's better to start with unofficial practice tests with explanations for every question. 

10. [AWS re/Start development program](https://aws.amazon.com/training/restart/)

I recently came across this program. From what I understood, it is more than a training course. The program providers prepare individuals for entry-level careers in the cloud and connect them to potential employers. It is free and targets students, unemployed and military veterans. Unlike the training courses I mentioned above, it is Instructor-Led Training, meaning you will get a chance to collaborate with classmates in a virtual classroom setting. 

_This by no means is a comprehensive list but rather resources that I personally used or heard positive feedback from others. Of course, there is no need to use all the resources mentioned above. For example, the official free training + some introductory labs could be enough to pass the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. Use practice tests and quizzes to determine your exam readiness._

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

**Don't delay! Start your cloud journey today! Best of luck!**
