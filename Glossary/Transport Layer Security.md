Transport Layer Security

Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security [protocol](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/) designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the Internet. A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers, such as web browsers loading a website. TLS can also be used to encrypt other communications such as email, messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). In this article we will focus on the role of TLS in [web application security](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-web-application-security/).

TLS was proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an international standards organization, and the first version of the protocol was published in 1999. The most recent version is [TLS 1.3](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-use-tls-1.3/), which was published in 2018.
